## üöÄ Setup Steps

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Project

Open Terminal (Mac/Linux) or PowerShell (Windows) and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Suhas2609/Misconception-driven-STEM-question-generation-platform.git
cd Misconception-driven-STEM-question-generation-platform
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Setup Backend Environment

```bash
cd misconception_stem_rag
```

**Windows (PowerShell)**:
```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env
notepad .env
```

**Mac/Linux**:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
nano .env
```

**In the `.env` file**, find this line:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

Replace `your_openai_api_key_here` with your actual OpenAI API key from step 4 above.

Save and close the file.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Start the Backend

Still in the `misconception_stem_rag` directory, run:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will download and start all backend services (takes 2-3 minutes first time).

**Check if it worked**:
```bash
docker-compose ps
```

You should see 4 services running:
- ‚úÖ adaptive_api
- ‚úÖ mongo
- ‚úÖ redis
- ‚úÖ chroma

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Start the Frontend

Open a **NEW terminal window** and run:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

**Wait** until you see something like:
```
  ‚ûú  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
```

---

## ‚úÖ Access the Application

Open your browser and go to: **http://localhost:5173**

You should see the landing page! üéâ

---

## üéØ First Time Use

1. **Register**: Create your account
2. **Onboarding**: Answer 5 quick questions (calibrates your profile)
3. **Upload PDF**: Upload any STEM textbook or notes (Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Math)
4. **Take Quiz**: Select topics and start!

---

## üõë Stopping the Application

When you're done:

1. **Frontend**: Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where `npm run dev` is running
2. **Backend**: Run in the `misconception_stem_rag` directory:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

---

## üîÑ Restarting Later

**Backend**:
```bash
cd misconception_stem_rag
docker-compose up -d
```

**Frontend** (in a new terminal):
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

## ‚ùó Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Docker is not running"
**Solution**: Open Docker Desktop application

### Issue: "Port 8000 is already in use"
**Solution**: 
```bash
cd misconception_stem_rag
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
```

### Issue: "OpenAI API error"
**Solution**: 
- Double-check your API key in the `.env` file
- Make sure there are no extra spaces
- Verify the key is valid at https://platform.openai.com/api-keys

### Issue: Frontend shows "Network Error"
**Solution**: 
- Make sure backend is running: `docker-compose ps` (should show 4 services)
- Restart backend: `docker-compose restart api`

### Issue: Can't access http://localhost:5173
**Solution**: 
- Make sure `npm run dev` is running
- Try: `npm run dev -- --port 3000` (uses port 3000 instead)
