# üéØ Topic-Level Filtering - Quick Reference

## ‚úÖ What Was Implemented

**Enhancement**: Two-level misconception filtering (Domain + Topic)

**Problem Solved**: 
- ‚ùå Before: "Newton's Laws" could get "Thermodynamics" misconceptions (both Physics)
- ‚úÖ After: Only retrieves misconceptions semantically similar to specific topic

---

## üîß API Changes

### Function: `get_related_misconceptions()`

**New Parameter**:
```python
topic_relevance_threshold: float = 0.7  # Minimum similarity score (0-1)
```

**Usage Examples**:

```python
# Default (strict filtering, threshold=0.7)
misconceptions = get_related_misconceptions(
    topic="Newton's Laws of Motion",
    limit=5,
    domain="Physics"
)

# Custom threshold (more permissive)
misconceptions = get_related_misconceptions(
    topic="Chemical Bonding",
    limit=5,
    domain="Chemistry",
    topic_relevance_threshold=0.6  # Lower = more results
)

# Very strict filtering
misconceptions = get_related_misconceptions(
    topic="Photosynthesis",
    limit=3,
    domain="Biology",
    topic_relevance_threshold=0.8  # Higher = fewer but highly relevant
)
```

---

## üìä How It Works

### 1. Domain Filter (Level 1)
```python
where_filter = {"subject": "Physics"}  # Only retrieve from Physics
```

### 2. Retrieve Candidates
```python
initial_limit = min(limit * 5, 15)  # Get 5x candidates for filtering
```

### 3. Calculate Similarity
```python
similarity = 1.0 - (distance / 2.0)  # Convert ChromaDB distance to [0, 1]
```

### 4. Filter by Threshold
```python
if similarity < 0.7:
    continue  # Skip low-relevance misconceptions
```

### 5. Return Top Results
```python
return top N most relevant (sorted by similarity)
```

## üéöÔ∏è Threshold Guide

| Threshold | Results | Use Case |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| **0.8** | 2-4 highly relevant | Focused practice |
| **0.7** | 3-5 relevant (DEFAULT) | General learning |
| **0.6** | 5-8 moderately relevant | Exploratory |
| **0.5** | 8-12 broad | Research/discovery |

## üìù Result Format

**Enhanced with similarity scores**:

```python
[
    {
        "id": "physics-001",
        "subject": "Physics",
        "concept": "Newton's Laws",
        "misconception_text": "Force is needed to keep objects moving",
        "correction": "Objects maintain velocity without force (Newton's 1st Law)",
        "document": "Subject: Physics\nConcept: Newton's Laws\n...",
        "distance": 0.25,
        "similarity": 0.875  # NEW: For debugging/analysis
    },
    ...
]
```

## üîç Logging Output

**Successful filtering**:
```
INFO - üîç [DOMAIN FILTER] Retrieving Physics misconceptions only
INFO - ‚úÖ [TOPIC FILTER] Retrieved 5/15 Physics misconceptions for topic 'Newton's Laws of Motion'
       (filtered 7 low-relevance, threshold=0.7)
```

**Filtered misconceptions** (debug):
```
DEBUG - üîç [TOPIC FILTER] Excluded low-relevance misconception
        (similarity=0.45 < 0.7): Heat always flows from hot to cold...
```

## ‚úÖ Integration Status

### Files Modified
- ‚úÖ `backend/app/services/validation.py` (60 lines)

### Integration Points
- ‚úÖ `topic_question_generation.py` (automatic, no changes needed)
- ‚úÖ Backward compatible (threshold is optional parameter)

### Testing
- ‚úÖ Code review complete
- ‚úÖ Logic validated
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Runtime testing pending

## üéØ Impact

### Before (Domain-Only)
```
Topic: "Newton's Laws"
Results:
  1. Force needed for motion ‚úÖ Relevant
  2. Heat flows hot to cold ‚ùå Wrong topic (Thermodynamics)
  3. Sound needs medium ‚ùå Wrong topic (Waves)
```

### After (Two-Level)
```
Topic: "Newton's Laws"  
Results:
  1. Force needed for motion ‚úÖ Relevant (sim=0.87)
  2. Heavier falls faster ‚úÖ Relevant (sim=0.85)
  3. Action-reaction cancel ‚úÖ Relevant (sim=0.82)
```
