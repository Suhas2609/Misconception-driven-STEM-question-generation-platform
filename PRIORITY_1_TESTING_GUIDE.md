### Step 7: Data Accuracy

#### Backend Integration
- [ ] Score percentage matches backend response
- [ ] Correct/incorrect counts are accurate
- [ ] Misconception text displays correctly
- [ ] Learning tips appear for incorrect questions
- [ ] Confidence analysis is present

#### MongoDB Verification (Optional)
```powershell
docker exec -it mongo mongosh adaptive_stem_db
db.users.findOne({email: 'madhu@example.com'}, {personal_misconceptions: 1})
```

Check that:
- [ ] Misconceptions stored in database match UI display
- [ ] Severity is "high" for new misconceptions
- [ ] Frequency starts at 1
- [ ] Resolved is false

### Expected Results

#### ✅ **Success Criteria**
- All UI elements render correctly
- Misconception cards are visually distinct
- Remediation plan provides clear 4-step guidance
- Progress bar shows 1/3 for new misconceptions
- Trait badges are visible and properly labeled
- "What's Next?" guides next action
- No console errors in browser DevTools
- No syntax errors in terminal

#### ❌ **Common Issues**

**Issue**: Misconception summary card doesn't appear
- **Cause**: No misconceptions detected in response
- **Fix**: Answer at least 2 questions incorrectly

**Issue**: Progress bar shows wrong value
- **Fix**: Currently hardcoded to 33% (1/3) - will be dynamic in future

**Issue**: Trait badges don't show
- **Cause**: Backend might not return trait linkages
- **Fix**: Check backend response in Network tab

**Issue**: Colors/gradients don't render

### Browser DevTools Checks

#### Console
```javascript
// Should see no errors
// Check feedback object structure
console.log(feedback)
```

#### Network Tab
- [ ] POST to `/submit_quiz` succeeds (200 status)
- [ ] Response contains `feedback` array
- [ ] Each feedback item has:
  - `explanation`
  - `misconception_addressed` (for wrong answers)
  - `confidence_analysis`
  - `learning_tips`

#### React DevTools
- [ ] `QuizPage` component renders
- [ ] `showResults` is true
- [ ] `feedback` state is populated
- [ ] `user` state contains `cognitive_traits`
