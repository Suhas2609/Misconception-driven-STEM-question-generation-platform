## 🔗 Integration with Backend

The enhanced UI consumes the existing feedback structure:

```javascript
{
  feedback: [
    {
      question_number: 1,
      is_correct: false,
      question_stem: "...",
      selected_answer: "...",
      explanation: "...",
      misconception_addressed: "Believes satellites...", // ← Enhanced display
      confidence_analysis: "...",
      learning_tips: ["...", "..."],
      encouragement: "..."
    }
  ],
  score_percentage: 33.33,
  correct_count: 1,
  total_questions: 3
}
```

**No backend changes required** - all enhancements are UI-only!
