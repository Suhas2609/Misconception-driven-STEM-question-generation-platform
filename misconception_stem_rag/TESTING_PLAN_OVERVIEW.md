# Step-by-Step Testing Plan
## Hybrid CDM-BKT-NLP Cognitive Trait Update System

---

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED: System Integration

The hybrid trait update system has been successfully integrated into your application:

### What's Been Implemented:

1. **`cognitive_trait_update.py` Service** (~350 lines)
   - CDM Q-matrix support with automatic inference
   - Bayesian posterior updates (not simple ¬±0.02)
   - GPT-4o NLP reasoning analysis
   - Confidence calibration (Brier score)
   - Kalman-style smoothing
   - Research citations embedded

2. **Integration into `pdf_upload.py`**
   - Replaced simple trait update logic (lines 635-651)
   - Now calls `CognitiveTraitUpdateService.update_traits_from_quiz()`
   - Passes full quiz context for intelligent updates

3. **Docker Container Rebuilt**
   - All code changes deployed
   - Server running successfully on localhost:8000
   - Frontend ready on localhost:5173

## üìã THREE-STEP TESTING PLAN

### **STEP 1: Test Current Hybrid System** ‚¨ÖÔ∏è YOU ARE HERE
**Goal**: Verify the hybrid CDM-BKT-NLP system works correctly

**Instructions**: See `STEP1_TEST_INSTRUCTIONS.md` for detailed testing procedure

**What to check**:
- ‚úÖ Traits update by different amounts (not uniform ¬±0.02)
- ‚úÖ GPT-4o reasoning analysis appears in logs
- ‚úÖ Metacognition increases when user writes "I'm not sure"
- ‚úÖ Confidence calibration penalizes overconfidence
- ‚úÖ Q-matrix inference targets correct traits

**Action Required**: 
1. Follow `STEP1_TEST_INSTRUCTIONS.md`
2. Take a quiz using the web UI
3. Monitor backend logs
4. Report findings

---

### **STEP 2: Add Explicit Q-matrix Tagging** (After Step 1 ‚úÖ)
**Goal**: Enhance precision by adding explicit trait tags to questions

**What will be changed**:
- Modify `topic_question_generation.py` to add `traits_targeted` field
- Update GPT-4o question generation prompt to infer traits
- Tag each question with 1-3 primary cognitive traits

**Example output**:
```python
{
  "question_number": 1,
  "stem": "Calculate the force...",
  "traits_targeted": ["precision", "analytical_depth"],  # ‚Üê NEW
  "requires_calculation": True
}
```

**Benefits**:
- More precise trait updates (physics question won't affect creativity)
- Better research documentation (explicit Q-matrix for papers)
- Easier validation and debugging

---

### **STEP 3: Create Trait History Visualization** (After Step 2 ‚úÖ)
**Goal**: Track trait evolution over time for research validation

**What will be added**:
1. **Trait History Collection** (MongoDB)
   - Store every trait update with timestamp
   - Include evidence details (question types, performance, reasoning quality)

2. **Timeline Endpoint** (`GET /users/me/trait-history`)
   - Returns trait evolution data
   - Filterable by date range, trait type

3. **Dashboard Visualization** (Optional Frontend)
   - Line chart showing trait progression
   - Annotations for major events (quizzes, achievements)

**Example data**:
```json
{
  "trait": "metacognition",
  "timeline": [
    {"timestamp": "2025-10-28T10:00:00", "value": 0.500, "event": "baseline"},
    {"timestamp": "2025-10-28T10:15:00", "value": 0.575, "event": "quiz_1"},
    {"timestamp": "2025-10-28T10:30:00", "value": 0.620, "event": "quiz_2"}
  ]
}
```

## üöÄ Current Status

**System Status**: ‚úÖ Ready for testing
- Backend: Running (localhost:8000)
- Frontend: Running (localhost:5173)
- Docker: All containers healthy
- Code: Hybrid system integrated and deployed

**Next Action**: Complete Step 1 testing by following `STEP1_TEST_INSTRUCTIONS.md`

**After You Test**: Report back with:
1. Did traits change by different amounts?
2. Did you see GPT-4o analysis logs?
3. Did metacognition respond to "I'm not sure" markers?
4. Any errors or unexpected behavior?

Then we'll proceed to Step 2! üéØ
