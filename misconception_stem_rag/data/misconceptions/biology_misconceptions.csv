Biology,Cell Structure,Plant cells don't have mitochondria because they have chloroplasts,Plant cells have both mitochondria (for respiration) and chloroplasts (for photosynthesis).
Biology,Genetics,Dominant traits are more common in populations,Dominance refers to expression in heterozygotes not population frequency.
Biology,Evolution,Evolution is a linear progression toward perfection,Evolution is branching and non-directional; species adapt to environments not toward perfection.
Biology,Photosynthesis,Plants only do photosynthesis and animals only do respiration,Plants do both photosynthesis (to make glucose) and cellular respiration (to use glucose).
Biology,Cell Division,Mitosis and meiosis are the same process,Mitosis produces identical diploid cells; meiosis produces non-identical haploid gametes.
