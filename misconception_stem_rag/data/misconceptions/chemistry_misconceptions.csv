Chemistry,Hydrogen Bonding,Hydrogen bonds are stronger than covalent bonds,Hydrogen bonds are weaker intermolecular forces; covalent bonds are stronger intramolecular bonds.
Chemistry,Hydrogen Bonding,Boiling point depends mainly on molecular mass,Boiling point is primarily determined by intermolecular forces like hydrogen bonding.
Chemistry,Hydrogen Bonding,Hydrogen bonding only occurs in water,Hydrogen bonding occurs in any molecule with H bonded to N O or F.
Chemistry,Chemical Bonding,Ionic bonds involve sharing electrons,Ionic bonds involve transfer of electrons; covalent bonds involve sharing.
Chemistry,Acids and Bases,All acids are dangerous and corrosive,Acid strength varies; some weak acids like acetic acid are safe to handle.
Chemistry,Redox Reactions,Oxidation always requires oxygen,Oxidation is loss of electrons and can occur without oxygen.
