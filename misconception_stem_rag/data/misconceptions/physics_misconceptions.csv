Physics,Newton's First Law,Objects in motion must have a force pushing them forward,Objects in motion stay in motion unless acted upon by an external force.
Physics,Newton's Second Law,Heavier objects fall faster because of greater force,Acceleration depends on net force and mass via F=ma.
Physics,Newton's Third Law,Action and reaction forces cancel each other out,Action-reaction forces act on different bodies so motion can still occur.
